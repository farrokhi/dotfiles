## alternatives tools

A list of alternative third-party tools to standard tools which are nice to have:

* `ack` as alternative to `grep`
* `icdiff` and `colordiff` look better than normal `diff`
* `yamllint` to verify sanity of yaml files
* `tig` and `cgit` as sidekick to `git` for browsing repos
